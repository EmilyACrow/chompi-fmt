# Chompi-Fmt

I created this app to make the process of loading samples into the Chompi sampler faster and more intuitive - rather than manually renaming (and trying to remember) all of your samples, one at a time, now you can use a web-based GUI to import, arrage, and load all of your samples. The project is incomplete, but the core functionality is present.
